This journal is my personal record of progress as I work toward earning my CCNA. I’ll document every lab I complete, the concepts I learn, and the challenges I overcome. My goal is to build a clear picture of how my skills develop over time. As I grow, I’m excited to look back on these entries and see how far I’ve come.

# CCNA Journey – Day 1  
**Lab Title: Network Devices **  
**Date: 11-21-25**

## 📌 Overview  
The main purpose of this lab is to introduce us to Packet Tracer. How to use a lot of the features that it has and then build a basic networking using two local area networks connecting to the internet so that they can connect to each other.

## 🧠 What I Learned  
-  How to create a network diagram. 
-  Understanding how client, firewalls, servers, switches, routers all connect together to create a network. 
-  Understanding the fundamentals of Packet Tracer.

following devices:

Cisco 2911 routers (x2)
